💡 Day 2: Mastering Python Data Structures and Control Flow
Day 1 was dedicated to building the absolute foundation of Python programming.
This involved hands-on practice with the three primary collection types—Lists, 
Tuples, and Sets—and mastering the essential control flow structures necessary for any real-world application.

       🔑 Key Concepts Covered
       
Concept     |  Python Structure | Focus/Goal
=======================================================================================================================


Fixed Data   | Tuples           | emonstrated immutability by attempting 
                                  (and failing) to add elements to a fixed tuple.
=======================================================================================================================



Unique 
Collections  | sets          | Practiced creating sets, adding/removing elements, and using the .union() method to merge 
                             sets while automatically removing duplicates. .
=======================================================================================================================


Dynamic Collections  | Lists          | Executed core list manipulation using methods like .append(), .remove(), and .insert() to dynamically modify data.
.
=======================================================================================================================



Iteration  | For/While Loops         | Used for loops with range() to generate numerical sequences (including mixed floats/integers) and implemented the while True loop for continuous user input.
.
=======================================================================================================================


Input Validation | I/O & Conditionals         | rote a robust program using a while loop to validate user input (name length and non-digit check) and practiced using the in operator to check for membership in a list (Favorite Fruits).
.
=======================================================================================================================



Application Logic | Pricing & Budgeting         | Developed a complete program to calculate variable costs (Pizza Toppings, Cinemax Tickets) based on conditional rules (if/elif/else) and aggregated the total cost.
